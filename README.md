Title
Residential housing price prediction model for institutional investors. 

Summary
Residential housing price prediction model helps to determine a pricing of the residential property based on a supervised machine learning model. 

Problem Statement
With price volatility in residential housing market, it is important to identify real estate properties that are undervalued or fairly priced for institutional investors. Price volatility has been steady for about one and half years so any prediction model must rely on recent historical data to predict existing real estate opportunities. 

Project
The data on recent home sale transactions were obtained from Cook County Assessorâ€™s Office (CCAO). Cook county is considered the second most populous county in the United States and home to the City of Chicago. Based on the available data, the supervised machine learning models was built. Initial base line model is based on regression. To further improve predicting capability XGBoost model was used to train the data. Further hyperparameters were tuned for the XGBoost model by applying hyperparameter optimization techniques and cross validation
